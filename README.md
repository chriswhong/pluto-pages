# pluto-pages
A Simple Data Explorer for NYC's PLUTO Tax Lot Dataset

# Why?
PLUTO is a great #opendata resource, but is published as raw spatial data meant to be consumed in GIS software.  The intent of pluto-pages is to provide a simple presentation of raw PLUTO data for an individual tax lot, complete with a deep linking URL.  Users can click on the map to see the data for a lot, or enter the {boro}/{block}/{lot} URL pattern on their own.
